# IF687 Data Visualization
# Simple Data Analysis with Matplotlib

A simple exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python.

This project was developed for the **Introduction to Multimedia** course at **CIn/UFPE**. The goal was to use `pandas` for data handling and `matplotlib` to create basic visualizations, exploring survival rates and other key metrics from the dataset.

The entire analysis is contained within the Google Colab notebook.

## Key Visualizations

The analysis includes the following plots:
* Line Chart
* Bar Chart
* Pie Chart
* Scatter Plot

## How to Run

Simply open the `.ipynb` notebook file in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment and run the cells.

The dataset is loaded directly from Kaggle within the notebook, so no manual download is required.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib kagglehub
